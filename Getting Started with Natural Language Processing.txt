# GETTING STARTED WITH NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING
--------------------------------------------------

* Text Preprocessing
--------------------
"You never know what you have... until you clean your data."
~ Unknown (or possibly made up)

Cleaning and preparation are crucial for many tasks, and NLP is no exception. Text preprocessing is usually the first step you’ll take when faced with an NLP task.

Without preprocessing, your computer interprets "the", "The", and "<p>The" as entirely different words. There is a LOT you can do here, depending on the formatting you need. Lucky for 
you, Regex and NLTK will do most of it for you! Common tasks include:

Noise removal — stripping text of formatting (e.g., HTML tags).
-------------

Tokenization — breaking text into individual words.
------------

Normalization — cleaning text data in any other way:
-------------

	. Stemming is a blunt axe to chop off word prefixes and suffixes. “booing” and “booed” become “boo”, but “computer” may become “comput” and “are” would remain “are.”
	  --------

	. Lemmatization is a scalpel to bring words down to their root forms. For example, NLTK’s savvy lemmatizer knows “am” and “are” are related to “be.”
	  -------------

	. Other common tasks include lowercasing, stopwords removal, spelling correction, etc.

Checkpoint 1 Passed
1.
We used NLTK’s PorterStemmer to normalize the text — run the code to see how it does. (It may take a few seconds for the code to run.)

Checkpoint 2 Passed
2.
In the output terminal you’ll see our program counts "go" and "went" as different words! Also, what’s up with "mani" and "hardli"? A lemmatizer will fix this. Let’s do it.

Where lemmatizer is defined, replace None with WordNetLemmatizer().

Where we defined lemmatized, replace the empty list with a list comprehension that uses lemmatizer to lemmatize() each token in tokenized.

(Don’t know Python that well? No problem. Just check the hints for help throughout the lesson.)


Hint
lemmatized = [lemmatizer.lemmatize(token) for token in tokenized]

Checkpoint 3 Passed
3.
Why are the lemmatized verbs like "went" still conjugated? By default lemmatize() treats every word as a noun.

Give lemmatize() a second argument: get_part_of_speech(token). This will tell our lemmatizer what part of speech the word is.

Run your code again to see the result!

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Language Models: Bag-of-Words
-------------------------------
How can we help a machine make sense of a bunch of word tokens? We can help computers make predictions about language by training a language model on a corpus (a bunch of example text).

Language models are probabilistic computer models of language. We build and use these models to figure out the likelihood that a given sound, letter, word, or phrase will be used. Once a 
---------------
model has been trained, it can be tested out on new texts.

One of the most common language models is the unigram model, a statistical language model commonly known as bag-of-words. As its name suggests, bag-of-words does not have much order to 
its chaos! What it does have is a tally count of each instance for each word. Consider the following text example:

The squids jumped out of the suitcases.

Provided some initial preprocessing, bag-of-words would result in a mapping like:

	{"the": 2, "squid": 1, "jump": 1, "out": 1, "of": 1, "suitcase": 1}

Now look at this sentence and mapping: “Why are your suitcases full of jumping squids?”

	{"why": 1, "be": 1, "your": 1, "suitcase": 1, "full": 1, "of": 1, "jump": 1, "squid": 1}

You can see how even with different word order and sentence structures, “jump,” “squid,” and “suitcase” are shared topics between the two examples. Bag-of-words can be an excellent way of 
looking at language when you want to make predictions concerning topic or sentiment of a text. When grammar and word order are irrelevant, this is probably a good model to use.

Now let’s turn this list into a bag-of-words using Counter()!

Comment out the print statement and set bag_of_looking_glass_words equal to a call of Counter() on normalized. Print bag_of_looking_glass_words. What are the most common words?


Hint
	bag_of_looking_glass_words = Counter(normalized)

cleaned = re.sub('\W+', ' ', text).lower()
tokenized = word_tokenize(cleaned)

stop_words = stopwords.words('english')
filtered = [word for word in tokenized if word not in stop_words]

normalizer = WordNetLemmatizer()
normalized = [normalizer.lemmatize(token, get_part_of_speech(token)) for token in filtered]
# Comment out the print statement below
#print(normalized)

# Define bag_of_looking_glass_words & print:
bag_of_looking_glass_words = Counter(normalized)
print(bag_of_looking_glass_words)

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Language Models: N-Gram and NLM
---------------------------------
For parsing entire phrases or conducting language prediction, you will want to use a model that pays attention to each word’s neighbors. Unlike bag-of-words, the n-gram model considers a 
+sequence of some number (n) units and calculates the probability of each unit in a body of language given the preceding sequence of length n. Because of this, n-gram probabilities with 
larger n values can be impressive at language prediction.

Take a look at our revised squid example: “The squids jumped out of the suitcases. The squids were furious.”

A bigram model (where n is 2) might give us the following count frequencies:

	{('', 'the'): 2, ('the', 'squids'): 2, ('squids', 'jumped'): 1, ('jumped', 'out'): 1, ('out', 'of'): 1, ('of', 'the'): 1, ('the', 'suitcases'): 1, ('suitcases', ''): 1, 
	('squids', 'were'): 1, ('were', 'furious'): 1, ('furious', ''): 1}

There are a couple problems with the n gram model:

	1. How can your language model make sense of the sentence “The cat fell asleep in the mailbox” if it’s never seen the word “mailbox” before? During training, your model will 
	probably come across test words that it has never encountered before (this issue also pertains to bag of words). A tactic known as language smoothing can help adjust probabilities 
	for unknown words, but it isn’t always ideal.

	2. For a model that more accurately predicts human language patterns, you want n (your sequence length) to be as large as possible. That way, you will have more natural sounding 
	language, right? Well, as the sequence length grows, the number of examples of each sequence within your training corpus shrinks. With too few examples, you won’t have enough data 
	to make many predictions.

Enter neural language models (NLMs)! Much recent work within NLP has involved developing and training neural networks to approximate the approach our human brains take towards language. 
This deep learning approach allows computers a much more adaptive tack to processing human language. Common NLMs include LSTMs and transformer models.

Checkpoint 1 Passed
1.
If you run the code, you’ll see the 10 most commonly used words in Through the Looking Glass parsed with NLTK’s ngrams module — if you’re thinking this looks like a bag of words, that’s 
because it is one!

Checkpoint 2 Passed
2.
What do you think the most common phrases in the text are? Let’s find out…

Where looking_glass_bigrams is defined, change the second argument to 2 to see bigrams. Change n to 3 for looking_glass_trigrams to see trigrams.


Hint
The ngrams() function takes two arguments: the text you want to use and the n value.

Checkpoint 3 Passed
3.
Change n to a number greater than 3 for looking_glass_ngrams. Try increasing the number.

At what n are you just getting lines from poems repeated in the text? This is where there may be too few examples of each sequence within your training corpus to make any helpful 
predictions.

* Topic Models
--------------
We’ve touched on the idea of finding topics within a body of language. But what if the text is long and the topics aren’t obvious?

Topic modeling is an area of NLP dedicated to uncovering latent, or hidden, topics within a body of language. For example, one Codecademy curriculum developer used topic modeling to 
--------------
discover patterns within Taylor Swift songs related to love and heartbreak over time.

A common technique is to deprioritize the most common words and prioritize less frequently used terms as topics in a process known as term frequency-inverse document frequency (tf-idf). 
Say what?! This may sound counter-intuitive at first. Why would you want to give more priority to less-used words? Well, when you’re working with a lot of text, it makes a bit of sense if 
you don’t want your topics filled with words like “the” and “is.” The Python libraries gensim and sklearn have modules to handle tf-idf.

Whether you use your plain bag of words (which will give you term frequency) or run it through tf-idf, the next step in your topic modeling journey is often latent Dirichlet allocation 
(LDA). LDA is a statistical model that takes your documents and determines which words keep popping up together in the same contexts (i.e., documents). We’ll use sklearn to tackle this 
for us.

If you have any interest in visualizing your newly minted topics, word2vec is a great technique to have up your sleeve. word2vec can map out your topic model results spatially as vectors 
so that similarly used words are closer together. In the case of a language sample consisting of “The squids jumped out of the suitcases. The squids were furious. Why are your suitcases 
full of jumping squids?”, we might see that “suitcase”, “jump”, and “squid” were words used within similar contexts. This word-to-vector mapping is known as a word embedding.

Checkpoint 1 Passed
1.
Check out how the bag of words model and tf-idf models stack up when faced with a new Sherlock Holmes text!

Run the code as is to see what topics they uncover…

Checkpoint 2 Passed
2.
Tf-idf has some interesting findings, but the regular bag of words is full of words that tell us very little about the topic of the texts!

Let’s fix this. Add some words to stop_list that don’t tell you much about the topic and then run your code again. Do this until you have at least 10 words in stop_list so that the bag of words LDA model has some interesting topics.


Hint
Some words you may want to add to the stop_list:

"say", "see", "holmes", "shall", "say", 
"man", "upon", "know", "quite", "one", 
"well", "could", "would", "take", "may",

* Text Similarity
-----------------
Most of us have a good autocorrect story. Our phone’s messenger quietly swaps one letter for another as we type and suddenly the meaning of our message has changed (to our horror or 
pleasure). However, addressing text similarity — including spelling correction — is a major challenge within natural language processing.

Addressing word similarity and misspelling for spellcheck or autocorrect often involves considering the Levenshtein distance or minimal edit distance between two words. The distance is 
calculated through the minimum number of insertions, deletions, and substitutions that would need to occur for one word to become another. For example, turning “bees” into “beans” would 
require one substitution (“a” for “e”) and one insertion (“n”), so the Levenshtein distance would be two.

Phonetic similarity is also a major challenge within speech recognition. English-speaking humans can easily tell from context whether someone said “euthanasia” or “youth in Asia,” but 
it’s a far more challenging task for a machine! More advanced autocorrect and spelling correction technology additionally considers key distance on a keyboard and phonetic similarity (how 
much two words or phrases sound the same).

It’s also helpful to find out if texts are the same to guard against plagiarism, which we can identify through lexical similarity (the degree to which texts use the same vocabulary and 
phrases). Meanwhile, semantic similarity (the degree to which documents contain similar meaning or topics) is useful when you want to find (or recommend) an article or book similar to one 
you recently finished.

* Instructions
--------------
Checkpoint 1 Passed
1.
Assign the variable three_away_from_code a word with a Levenshtein distance of 3 from “code”. Assign two_away_from_chunk a word with a Levenshtein distance of 2 from “chunk”.


Hint
Each insertion, deletion, or substitution counts as an edit distance of 1.

script.py
---------
import nltk
# NLTK has a built-in function
# to check Levenshtein distance:
from nltk.metrics import edit_distance

def print_levenshtein(string1, string2):
  print("The Levenshtein distance from '{0}' to '{1}' is {2}!".format(string1, string2, edit_distance(string1, string2)))

# Check the distance between
# any two words here!
print_levenshtein("fart", "target")

# Assign passing strings here:
three_away_from_code = "rate"

two_away_from_chunk = "chant"

print_levenshtein("code", three_away_from_code)
print_levenshtein("chunk", two_away_from_chunk)

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Language Prediction & Text Generation
---------------------------------------
How does your favorite search engine complete your search queries? How does your phone’s keyboard know what you want to type next? Language prediction is an application of NLP concerned 
with predicting text given preceding text. Autosuggest, autocomplete, and suggested replies are common forms of language prediction.

Your first step to language prediction is picking a language model. Bag of words alone is generally not a great model for language prediction; no matter what the preceding word was, you 
will just get one of the most commonly used words from your training corpus.

If you go the n-gram route, you will most likely rely on Markov chains to predict the statistical likelihood of each following word (or character) based on the training corpus. Markov 
chains are memory-less and make statistical predictions based entirely on the current n-gram on hand.

For example, let’s take a sentence beginning, “I ate so many grilled cheese”. Using a trigram model (where n is 3), a Markov chain would predict the following word as “sandwiches” based 
on the number of times the sequence “grilled cheese sandwiches” has appeared in the training data out of all the times “grilled cheese” has appeared in the training data.

A more advanced approach, using a neural language model, is the Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) model. LSTM uses deep learning with a network of artificial “cells” that manage memory, 
making them better suited for text prediction than traditional neural networks.

* Advanced NLP Topics
---------------------
Believe it or not, you’ve just scratched the surface of natural language processing. There are a slew of advanced topics and applications of NLP, many of which rely on deep learning and 
neural networks.

	. Naive Bayes classifiers are supervised machine learning algorithms that leverage a probabilistic theorem to make predictions and classifications. They are widely used for 
	-------------------------
	sentiment analysis (determining whether a given block of language expresses negative or positive feelings) and spam filtering.


	. We’ve made enormous gains in machine translation, but even the most advanced translation software using neural networks and LSTM still has far to go in accurately translating 
	between languages.


	. Some of the most life-altering applications of NLP are focused on improving language accessibility for people with disabilities. Text-to-speech functionality and speech 
	recognition have improved rapidly thanks to neural language models, making digital spaces far more accessible places.


	. NLP can also be used to detect bias in writing and speech. Feel like a political candidate, book, or news source is biased but can’t put your finger on exactly how? Natural 	
	language processing can help you identify the language at issue.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Challenges and Considerations
-------------------------------
As you’ve seen, there are a vast array of applications for NLP. However, as they say, “with great language processing comes great responsibility” (or something along those lines). When 
working with NLP, we have several important considerations to take into account:

	. Different NLP tasks may be more or less difficult in different languages. Because so many NLP tools are built by and for English speakers, these tools may lag behind in 
	processing other languages. The tools may also be programmed with cultural and linguistic biases specific to English speakers.

	. What if your Amazon Alexa could only understand wealthy men from coastal areas of the United States? English itself is not a homogeneous body. English varies by person, by 
	dialect, and by many sociolinguistic factors. When we build and train NLP tools, are we only building them for one type of English speaker?

	. You can have the best intentions and still inadvertently program a bigoted tool. While NLP can limit bias, it can also propagate bias. As an NLP developer, it’s important to 
	consider biases, both within your code and within the training corpus. A machine will learn the same biases you teach it, whether intentionally or unintentionally.

	. As you become someone who builds tools with natural language processing, it’s vital to take into account your users’ privacy. There are many powerful NLP tools that come 
	head-to-head with privacy concerns. Who is collecting your data? How much data is being collected and what do those companies plan to do with your data?
