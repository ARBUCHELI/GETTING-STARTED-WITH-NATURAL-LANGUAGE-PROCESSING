# GETTING STARTED WITH NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING
--------------------------------------------------

* Text Preprocessing
--------------------
"You never know what you have... until you clean your data."
~ Unknown (or possibly made up)

Cleaning and preparation are crucial for many tasks, and NLP is no exception. Text preprocessing is usually the first step you’ll take when faced with an NLP task.

Without preprocessing, your computer interprets "the", "The", and "<p>The" as entirely different words. There is a LOT you can do here, depending on the formatting you need. Lucky for 
you, Regex and NLTK will do most of it for you! Common tasks include:

Noise removal — stripping text of formatting (e.g., HTML tags).
-------------

Tokenization — breaking text into individual words.
------------

Normalization — cleaning text data in any other way:
-------------

	. Stemming is a blunt axe to chop off word prefixes and suffixes. “booing” and “booed” become “boo”, but “computer” may become “comput” and “are” would remain “are.”
	  --------

	. Lemmatization is a scalpel to bring words down to their root forms. For example, NLTK’s savvy lemmatizer knows “am” and “are” are related to “be.”
	  -------------

	. Other common tasks include lowercasing, stopwords removal, spelling correction, etc.

* Instructions
--------------
Checkpoint 1 Passed
1.
We used NLTK’s PorterStemmer to normalize the text — run the code to see how it does. (It may take a few seconds for the code to run.)

Checkpoint 2 Passed
2.
In the output terminal you’ll see our program counts "go" and "went" as different words! Also, what’s up with "mani" and "hardli"? A lemmatizer will fix this. Let’s do it.

Where lemmatizer is defined, replace None with WordNetLemmatizer().

Where we defined lemmatized, replace the empty list with a list comprehension that uses lemmatizer to lemmatize() each token in tokenized.

(Don’t know Python that well? No problem. Just check the hints for help throughout the lesson.)


Hint
lemmatized = [lemmatizer.lemmatize(token) for token in tokenized]

Checkpoint 3 Passed
3.
Why are the lemmatized verbs like "went" still conjugated? By default lemmatize() treats every word as a noun.

Give lemmatize() a second argument: get_part_of_speech(token). This will tell our lemmatizer what part of speech the word is.

Run your code again to see the result!


Hint
lemmatized = [lemmatizer.lemmatize(token, get_part_of_speech(token)) for token in tokenized]

I went to the dentist the other day, and sure enough I saw an angry one jump out of my dentist's bag within minutes of arriving. She hardly even noticed."

* Language Models: Bag-of-Words
-------------------------------
How can we help a machine make sense of a bunch of word tokens? We can help computers make predictions about language by training a language model on a corpus (a bunch of example text).

Language models are probabilistic computer models of language. We build and use these models to figure out the likelihood that a given sound, letter, word, or phrase will be used. Once a 
---------------
model has been trained, it can be tested out on new texts.

One of the most common language models is the unigram model, a statistical language model commonly known as bag-of-words. As its name suggests, bag-of-words does not have much order to 
its chaos! What it does have is a tally count of each instance for each word. Consider the following text example:

The squids jumped out of the suitcases.

Provided some initial preprocessing, bag-of-words would result in a mapping like:

	{"the": 2, "squid": 1, "jump": 1, "out": 1, "of": 1, "suitcase": 1}

Now look at this sentence and mapping: “Why are your suitcases full of jumping squids?”

	{"why": 1, "be": 1, "your": 1, "suitcase": 1, "full": 1, "of": 1, "jump": 1, "squid": 1}

You can see how even with different word order and sentence structures, “jump,” “squid,” and “suitcase” are shared topics between the two examples. Bag-of-words can be an excellent way of 
looking at language when you want to make predictions concerning topic or sentiment of a text. When grammar and word order are irrelevant, this is probably a good model to use.

* Instructions
--------------
Checkpoint 1 Passed
1.
We’ve turned a passage from Through the Looking Glass by Lewis Carroll into a list of words (aside from stopwords, which we’ve removed) using nltk preprocessing. Run your code to see the 
full list.

Checkpoint 2 Passed
2.
Now let’s turn this list into a bag-of-words using Counter()!

Comment out the print statement and set bag_of_looking_glass_words equal to a call of Counter() on normalized. Print bag_of_looking_glass_words. What are the most common words?


Hint
	bag_of_looking_glass_words = Counter(normalized)

Checkpoint 3 Passed
3.
Try changing text to another string of your choosing and see what happens!

script.py
---------
# importing regex and nltk
import re, nltk
from nltk.corpus import stopwords
from nltk.tokenize import word_tokenize
from nltk.stem import WordNetLemmatizer
# importing Counter to get word counts for bag of words
from collections import Counter
# importing a passage from Through the Looking Glass
from looking_glass import looking_glass_text
# importing part-of-speech function for lemmatization
from part_of_speech import get_part_of_speech

# Change text to another string:
#text = looking_glass_text
text = 'Come as you are, as you were, as I want you to be'

cleaned = re.sub('\W+', ' ', text).lower()
tokenized = word_tokenize(cleaned)

stop_words = stopwords.words('english')
filtered = [word for word in tokenized if word not in stop_words]

normalizer = WordNetLemmatizer()
normalized = [normalizer.lemmatize(token, get_part_of_speech(token)) for token in filtered]
# Comment out the print statement below
#print(normalized)

# Define bag_of_looking_glass_words & print:
bag_of_looking_glass_words = Counter(normalized)
print(bag_of_looking_glass_words)

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Language Models: N-Gram and NLM
---------------------------------
For parsing entire phrases or conducting language prediction, you will want to use a model that pays attention to each word’s neighbors. Unlike bag-of-words, the n-gram model considers a 
+sequence of some number (n) units and calculates the probability of each unit in a body of language given the preceding sequence of length n. Because of this, n-gram probabilities with 
larger n values can be impressive at language prediction.

Take a look at our revised squid example: “The squids jumped out of the suitcases. The squids were furious.”

A bigram model (where n is 2) might give us the following count frequencies:

	{('', 'the'): 2, ('the', 'squids'): 2, ('squids', 'jumped'): 1, ('jumped', 'out'): 1, ('out', 'of'): 1, ('of', 'the'): 1, ('the', 'suitcases'): 1, ('suitcases', ''): 1, 
	('squids', 'were'): 1, ('were', 'furious'): 1, ('furious', ''): 1}

There are a couple problems with the n gram model:

	1. How can your language model make sense of the sentence “The cat fell asleep in the mailbox” if it’s never seen the word “mailbox” before? During training, your model will 
	probably come across test words that it has never encountered before (this issue also pertains to bag of words). A tactic known as language smoothing can help adjust probabilities 
	for unknown words, but it isn’t always ideal.

	2. For a model that more accurately predicts human language patterns, you want n (your sequence length) to be as large as possible. That way, you will have more natural sounding 
	language, right? Well, as the sequence length grows, the number of examples of each sequence within your training corpus shrinks. With too few examples, you won’t have enough data 
	to make many predictions.

Enter neural language models (NLMs)! Much recent work within NLP has involved developing and training neural networks to approximate the approach our human brains take towards language. 
This deep learning approach allows computers a much more adaptive tack to processing human language. Common NLMs include LSTMs and transformer models.

* Instructions
--------------
Checkpoint 1 Passed
1.
If you run the code, you’ll see the 10 most commonly used words in Through the Looking Glass parsed with NLTK’s ngrams module — if you’re thinking this looks like a bag of words, that’s 
because it is one!

Checkpoint 2 Passed
2.
What do you think the most common phrases in the text are? Let’s find out…

Where looking_glass_bigrams is defined, change the second argument to 2 to see bigrams. Change n to 3 for looking_glass_trigrams to see trigrams.


Hint
The ngrams() function takes two arguments: the text you want to use and the n value.

Checkpoint 3 Passed
3.
Change n to a number greater than 3 for looking_glass_ngrams. Try increasing the number.

At what n are you just getting lines from poems repeated in the text? This is where there may be too few examples of each sequence within your training corpus to make any helpful 
predictions.
